# Solo Project Class Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

Use the twilio-ruby gem to implement this next one. You will need to use doubles too.

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.

## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer and public methods with all parameters and return values._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

class Reminder
  def initialize(name) # name is a string
    # ...
  end

  def remind_me_to(task) # task is a string
    # No return value
  end

  def remind()
    # Throws an exception if no task is set
    # Otherwise, returns a string reminding the user to do the task
  end
end
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# 1
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("Walk the dog")
reminder.remind() # => "Walk the dog, Kay!"

# 2
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind() # fails with "No task set."

# 3
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("")
reminder.remind() # => ", Kay!"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# `includes_todo?` checks if text includes the string '#TODO'
includes_todo = includes_todo?(text)

text: a string (e.g. "hello WORLD")
includes_todo: a boolean (e.g. false)

# The method doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

includes_todo?("Hello world") => false
includes_todo?("#TODO Hello world") => true
includes_todo?("Hello world #TODO") => true
includes_todo?("") => true
includes_todo?(nil) => throws an error
includes_todo?(1) => throws an error
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
